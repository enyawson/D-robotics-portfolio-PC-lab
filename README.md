## üëã About Me

I am interested in building **adaptive robotic intelligence** that continuously improves during deployment using **closed-loop perception and control**. My research focuses on enabling robots to **learn from experience in real time**, not just from offline training, by integrating **test-time adaptation, lifelong learning, and safe self-correction** within dynamic and uncertain environments. My long-term goal is to bridge the gap between **lab-trained models and real-world robot behavior**, developing systems that are **robust, context-aware, and capable of evolving after deployment**.
